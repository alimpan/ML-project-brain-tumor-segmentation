# ML-project-brain-tumor-segmentation

This is a semantic segmentation of brain tumors using 3D MRI scans . 
The goal is to predict the location of the tumor and separating it from the near by healthy tissue.

Dataset used: Brats 2018 Data (HGG images only)

Used architecture: UNet 2D, UNet 3D

Though I achieved poor results using UNet 3D as I had to work only in google colab. I hope to get it corrected soon.
Thank you for visiting my work.
