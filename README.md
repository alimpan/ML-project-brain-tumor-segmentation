# Segmentation of Brain Tumors from 3D MRI scans:

This is a semantic segmentation of brain tumors using 3D MRI scans . 
The goal is to predict the location of the tumor and separating it from the near by healthy tissue.

Dataset used: Brats 2018 Data (HGG images only).

Used architecture: UNet 2D, UNet 3D (I have two seperate notebooks for them)

There are two seperate notebooks for UNet 2D and UNet3D . UNet is a popular architecture in the Bio-medical imaging sector. 
If you want to understand UNet better the link below can be a good resource.

Also, I plan to implement the VNet3d soon.

Thank you for your patience
